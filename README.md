# LottieFlutter

Lottie-Flutter is based on [Lottie-Android](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android)

Lottie is a mobile library that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as json with [Bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) and renders them natively on mobile!
